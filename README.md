# Report Assistant

### purpose of the projects:

- In our development life cycle, Often we need to compare with Csv or other files. Specially when we have been working
  with payment related services It was very difficult for us to compare multiple csv that contains lots of rows. Same
  situations was created for me when I had been worked with payment related Spring batch project. So i decided to
  develop a report comparison related project which could help me at that purpose.

### Accuracy:

- Project Accuracy was not calculated yet but there need to work more and there are plans to improve the project when i
  will get free time. Now it is very initial stage.

### Algorithms

- Initially planned to use Genetic Algorithm (GA). But I will update it ML more precise algorithm.
